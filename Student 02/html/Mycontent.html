            <p>finding solutions like eco friendly fuels while working with the locals. Eco fiendly freight solutionsand latest technologies including alternating fuels for heavy duty vehicles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geothermal Power Plants:</strong> These are typically located near tectonic plate boundaries where geothermal activity is more pronounced. 
                    They use steam produced from reservoirs of hot water found a few miles below the Earth's surface. 
                    The steam is brought to the surface, used to drive a turbine connected to a generator, 
                    and then condensed back into water and reinjected into the ground.</li>

                <li><strong>Direct Use Applications:</strong>  
                    Geothermal heat can also be used directly for heating buildings, greenhouses, and industrial processes.</li>
