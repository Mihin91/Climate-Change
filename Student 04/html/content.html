            <h3>Climate MITIGATION</h3>
            <h2>Climate change adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies to address the challenges caused by global warming</h2>
            <p>•	Mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, tackling the root cause of climate change. Actions include transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar energy, hydro power and geothermal energy, protecting forests, and enhancing carbon sinks. Proactive mitigation is crucial to prevent severe climate scenarios.</p>

            <h3>CLIMATE ADAPTATION</h3>
            <h2>Climate change adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies to address the challenges caused by global warming</h2>
            <p>•	Adaptation aims to help communities adjust to current and future climate effects. Examples include improving infrastructure (such as storm drain systems), restoring natural habitats (like wetlands), and promoting behavioral changes (such as choosing climate-resilient crops). A holistic approach prepares us for the impacts of climate change.</p>
