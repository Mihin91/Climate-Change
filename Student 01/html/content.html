            <h2>Solar Renewable Energy</h2>
            <p>Solar energy harnesses the power of the sun's rays to generate electricity or heat. 
            This is done using solar panels (photovoltaic cells) or solar thermal systems</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Photovoltaic (PV) Cells:</strong>
                    These convert sunlight directly into electricity. When sunlight hits the PV cells, 
                    it excites electrons in the material, generating an electric current.</li>

                <li><strong>Solar Thermal Systems:</strong> 
                    These use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver, 
                    which absorbs and converts it into heat. 
                    This heat can then be used to produce steam that drives a turbine connected to a generator.</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <h2>Wind Renewable Energy</h2>
            <p>Wind energy converts the kinetic energy from wind into mechanical power or electricity using wind turbines.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wind Turbines:</strong> These have blades that rotate when wind flows over them. 
                    The rotation turns a shaft connected to a generator, which produces electricity. 
                    There are two main types of wind turbines: onshore and offshore.</li>      
            </ul>
        </div>

    <section id="hydro">
        <div>
            <h2>Hydro Renewable Energy</h2>
            <p>Hydropower, or hydro energy, utilizes the energy of flowing water to generate electricity. 
            This is typically done with dams or other water control structures.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dams and Reservoirs:</strong>
                    Water stored in a reservoir behind a dam is released to flow through turbines. The flowing water turns the turbines, 
                    which drive generators to produce electricity.</li>
                <li><strong>Run-of-the-River Systems:</strong> 
                    These use the natural flow of a river without a large reservoir, 
                    diverting a portion of the river through turbines before returning it to the riverbed.</li>
            </ul>

    <section id="geothermal">
        <img src="../images/geo.jpg" alt="Geothermal Energy">
        <div>
            <h2>Geothermal Renewable Energy</h2>
            <p>Geothermal energy harnesses heat from beneath the Earth's surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geothermal Power Plants:</strong> These are typically located near tectonic plate boundaries where geothermal activity is more pronounced. 
                    They use steam produced from reservoirs of hot water found a few miles below the Earth's surface. 
                    The steam is brought to the surface, used to drive a turbine connected to a generator, 
                    and then condensed back into water and reinjected into the ground.</li>

                <li><strong>Direct Use Applications:</strong>  
                    Geothermal heat can also be used directly for heating buildings, greenhouses, and industrial processes.</li>
